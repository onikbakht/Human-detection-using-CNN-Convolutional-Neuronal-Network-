here we get an extreamly high accuracy, as we have a lot of model parameters which leads to an strong model

but in the same time, as it comes to realtime test, the proble is sometimes, the ajcket on the chair, or some positions of the box on the chair are considered as human.
therefore we need more data of non human cases, like jacket on the chair, or box on the chair, and anything possible on the chair, also on the ground, and the rolling box, so tha
we dont get mistakenly classified objects as human
